# thebutton

This is a small project I made when I learnt Flask framework. It registers every user's click time into database, and updates the list of click time information across all the users. It also includes a small API that allows users to register themselves withouting opening the browser.

Framework: Flask, bootstrap<br>
Database: SQLalchemy + SQLITE <br>
realtime: Socketio
